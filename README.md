# MedianTrees

MedianTrees is a web application for calculating *Estimated Completion Times* based on a recent [cool statistical study on developer time estimates](https://thesearesystems.substack.com/p/task-estimation-conquering-hofstadters?triedRedirect=true
).

For each leaf task on the task tree, you must estimate the number of hours to completion. 
MedianTrees will then display

${\color{red}median\ time\ (what\ to\ tell\ your\ boss\ )}$ | ${\color{yellow}p=0.95\ (what\ to\ tell\ a\ stakeholder\ )}$ | ${\color{green}p=0.99\ (what\ to\ tell\ a\ really\ important\ stakeholder\ )}$

like this 

## How to use

You can input tasks by hand or import tasks from a Jira board. 
For Jira, export to csv with all attributes, then load the csv file with the `Load Jira` button
